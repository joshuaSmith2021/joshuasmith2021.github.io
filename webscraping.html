                <p>
                    With graphics cards being a very important part of a gaming PC,
                    it is important to make sure that you buy a powerful one for a good price.
                    To help people discover which graphics card is right for them, I added a
                    command to my Discord bot that shows people how powerful the Radeon and
                    GeForce cards are compared to one another to help them pick a card.

                <h1 class="segoe">Data Source</h1>
                <p>
                    When I was deciding what I would be buying for gaming, I used
                    <a href="https://www.logicalincrements.com/articles/graphicscardcomparison">a great chart by Logical Increments</a>.
                    I thought the cards were well-organized, so I thought that it would be the
                    perfect site to scrape. However, it wasn't super simple to scrape. The actual
                    data was fetched with JavaScript, so just sending a GET request with Python
                    requests wasn't going to have the data I needed. It wasn't a huge barrier,
                    so I opened the console and inspected the network requests being sent when
                    the page loaded. From here, it wasn't too hard to find the URL that I needed
                    to GET.

                <p>
                    Once I was able to get data into a Python script, connecting the data to Discord
                    wasn't too hard. I always use Discord.py when making bots, so I just added a
                    command to my main bot that sent a Discord embed to the channel to where the
                    command was sent.
